        <p class="body-abitmore-text">I'm Male, 17 and from Barcelona, Spain. I am currently studying to become a game programmer, game designer and/or artist.<br /><br />
        I want to bring my ideas to life and to express my creative passion through videogames and art! I've been a hobbyist game developer since 2020, using the GameMaker engine to learn and create
        and a hobbyist artist since 2022, drawing for fun using Krita.<br /><br />
        I built this website myself! I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to building websites, but it looks great to me. I use this website mainly as a portfolio, but I also want to put web games that I make here!<br /><br />
        You might see me at videogame development related events and conventions around Catalonia or Spain! Mainly, IndieDevDay.<br /><br />
        I go by ECSP online and ECSPdragon is the website mascot!

    <h1 class="showcase" style="color: #ff0044;">GAMES</h1>
    <p class="showcase">I've been interested in making games since sixth grade, but I haven't been able to actually make any serious projects (yet).<br  />
        I use GameMaker to make my games. Big fan of the engine because it's both easy and powerful.<br  />
        For browser games, go to the Browser Games section.</p>
    
    <h1 class="showcase" style="color: #00cdff;">DIGITAL ART</h1>
    <p class="showcase">My favorite kinds of art to do are concept art, dragons and cartooniness. I love anything Art Deco, Neon or just plain fancy.<br  />
        I use an <a style="color:lightgray;" target="_blank" href="https://www.xp-pen.com/product/artist-16-2nd-gen.html">XP-PEN Artist 16" Drawing Tablet. </a>See my art here!</p>
    
    <h1 class="showcase" style="color: #ff3c00;">3D MODELING</h1>
    <p class="showcase">I like doing low-poly and cartoonish modeling using Blender. I'm still learning and I don't know a lot of concepts though!</p>
