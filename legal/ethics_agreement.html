        <h1>Ethics Agreement Document</h1>
        <h3>You must agree to this document in order to be able to use any products, media or services owned by ecsp.dev or Studio ECSP.</h3>

    <div class="legal-contents">
        <p>This document details a set of statements that, by accepting this Ethics Agreement document, you are agreeing with.</p>
        <p>To retract your agreement with this Ethics Agreement document, you must stop using any products, media of services produced and/or
            owned by ecsp.dev or Studio ECSP.</p>
        
        <h1>1. The ceremonial nature of the document</h1>
        <p>This document serves as a stand against those who seek to spread harm and malice in the world, but while noble in intention, we recognize that
        freedom of speech and freedom of belief are important, so the nature of this document is purely ceremonial and does not hold up in any legal proceeding. This means that we will not seek legal action if
        you breach this agreement while using any ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP services or products, it'd be foolish to.<br/>However, even if largely unenforced, we reserve
        the right to enforce Section 3 of the document anyway on any users who blatantly break the agreement intentionally, for a prolonged amount of time. <br/>We believe
        that the statements laid out in Section 2 of the document are all fully true, though we do not objectively state that they are true, meaning that we believe we're
        in the right to enforce Section 3 freely on users who we believe have breached this agreement.
        <br/>TL;DR - This document is ceremonial, meaning it is not applicable in any legal procedure and we will leave it often unenforced (but we will still enforce it if blatantly and obviously breached).</p>
        
        <h1>2. Agreements</h1>
        
        <p>You agree with the following statements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All humans have the same rights, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, origin or mother tongue.</li>
            <li>LGBTQ+ people should not face persecution, discrimination or hate for their gender identity or sexual orientation.</li>
            <li>Targeting minorities with hate or violence is immoral and inexcusable.</li>        
            <li>Racism, Xenophobia, Homophobia and Transphobia are objectively wrong and should not be allowed.</li>
            <li>Transgender (Including Male to Female, Female to Male, Non-binary, Genderfluid... etc.) people are valid.</li>
            <li>White, "Aryan" supremacy or supremacy of any kind are horrible ideas and should not have a place in our world.</li>
            <li>There is no such thing as a "superior group of people".</li>
            <li>Fascist and fascist-adjacent ideology should not have a place in our world.</li>
            <li>Donald Trump is a Fascist.</li>
            <li>Elon Musk is a Technofascist oligarch.</li>
            <li>Donald Trump, Elon Musk and their allies have performed a mass misinformation campaign on U.S. news outlets and social media to gain influence and power.</li>
            <li>Generative AI is morally wrong and unethical.</li>
            <li>Generative AI output is inferior to human creative output in every single way.</li>
            <li>The mass scraping of media for AI training done by companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI or X (Formerly known as Twitter) is immoral and should be prohibited.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>3. Document breach</h1>
        <p>As previously stated, this document is not legally applicable in any way, therefore we will not seek legal action against those who breach it. Even then, we reserve the right to enforce the following punishments
        on any user who we deem to have breached the agreement in a blatant and obvious way.<br/>These punishments will go on effect 7 days after the agreement breach has been found and enforced.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Block the user on any ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP social media accounts.</li>
            <li>Delete the user's data on any ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP leaderboards or otherwise public databases.</li>
            <li>Ban the user from any ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP communities (Forums, Chat rooms... etc.).</li>
            <li>Restrict the user's access to ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP services.</li>
            <li>Restrict the user's ability to purchase some ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP products.</li>
            <li>If the user is a Ko-Fi supporter: Limit some of the Ko-Fi perks from the user.</li>
            <li>Deny customer support to any ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP users if the document has been enforced on them.</li>
        </ol>
