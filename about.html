        <p class="body-abitmore-text">I'm 18 and from Barcelona, Spain. I am currently studying to become a game programmer, game designer and/or artist.<br /><br />
        I want to bring my ideas to life and to express my creative passion through videogames and art! I've been a hobbyist game developer since 2020, using the GameMaker and Godot engines to learn and create
        and a hobbyist artist since 2022, drawing for fun using Krita.<br /><br />
        I built this website myself! I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to building websites, but it looks great to me. I use this website mainly as a portfolio, but I also want to put web games that I make here!<br /><br />
        You might see me at  videogame or gamedev related events and conventions around Catalonia or Spain!<br /><br />

    <p class="showcase">I've been interested in making games since sixth grade, but I haven't been able to actually make any serious projects until recently with HIThit.<br  />
        I've mastered Gamemaker and I'm in the process of learning to use Godot Engine.<br  />
        I make games under the alias "Studio ECSP" and I work on those projects with other people!</p>
