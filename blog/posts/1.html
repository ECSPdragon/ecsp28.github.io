            <p>Hello!! Welcome to the ecsp.dev posts, this is basically a blog page where i'll be sharing any news regarding the website or ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP. <br  /></p>
            <p>Don't expect to get updates every week or anything, writing these is kind of a pain. I don't have a proper blog editor, so i have to use phoenix code to manually code every page to have
            text it has, but it's not like much goes on in ecsp.dev anyway, let's talk about news, right?</p>
            <h1>Blog posts on ecsp.dev/blog</h1>
            <p>I can post blogs now! This was kind of long overdue. <br  /> From the bottom right of the main ecsp.dev website, you will now see a light crimson colored text with the header of the latest
            blog post (if you're seeing this on february 2025, it's this one).</p>
            <img src="../assets/blogs/001.png">
            <p style="color:lightgray">(I can insert images here too!)</p>
            <p>But if you want to stay updated with frequent gamedev stuff, you can join my <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#ecspdev:mozilla.org" target="_blank">matrix space</a> or
            <a href="https://discord.ecsp.dev" target="_blank">discord server</a></p>
            <h1>Ethics Agreement</h1>
            <p>From now on, if you use any of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browse ecsp.dev</li>
                <li>Play any Studio ECSP game</li>
                <li>Join any ecsp.dev/Studio ECSP community</li>
            </ul>
            <p>you'll be agreeing to this <a href="https://ecsp.dev/legal/ethics_agreement">ethics agreement document</a> which, among other things, denounces those who violate human rights. If
            you're offended and think that I'm biased and that both sides are bad, then I'd like you to remind me which side of the political spectrum is currently seeking to erradicate
            entire groups of people who have done nothing wrong but exist. Yes, I'm biased against the ideals of segregation, supremacy, billionaires and discrimination.
            If you don't agree with the ethics agreement, simply do not do any of the three things listed above or get a brick chucked at your head.</p>
            <p>You may find the ethics agreement document in the bottom left corner of the main page at any time.</p>
            <h1>Steam Creator page</h1>
            <p>Finally, I'm announcing my <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/studioecsp">Steam Creator page!</a> Obviously, there's no games there <i>yet</i>, but it'd be really cool if you still followed anyway.
            <br  />Studio ECSP's got a few ideas cooking, some of them will be web games right here and some of them will be on Steam.</p>
            <img src="../assets/blogs/002.png">
            <p>You can also find the link added to the top right of the main page!</p>
            <p>That's it for now, see you next time! ECSP.DEV!<br  />-ECSP</p>
