        <p>Hi hello welcome to my little corner of the web :) i'll keep it brief and divided into sections so you don't get bored</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Isabelle (Or rather "Isabel" in spanish) and I go under the alias ECSP online, I'm 18 as of writing this and I set up this website because I love learning tech stuff and making cool shit with it, even though webdev is an absolute hell. I want a main plsvr where I can fully control what I want to put here.</p>
        <p>I love being creative and being able to invent new things, whether that be ideas or doohickeys or art... I mainly focus on videogames but I also like drawing, modeling music production and even simple engineering with raspberry pis and arduinos! I made a tamagotchi with an arduino board once :) technology is so cool and I wish to use it to be creative and make fun quirky stuff too!!</p>
        <p>I <b>LOVE</b> reptiles. I don't think I'll ever actually have one as a pet, but I just find them really cute!! My favorite kinds of reptiles are monitor lizards, geckos, skinks, crocodilians and dragons.</p>
        <p>I'm a furry too :P if you reacted with disgust to that, you probably think that furries are something they actually aren't, so I made an entire subpage explaining what a furry ACTUALLY is <a href="furry.html" style="color: dodgerblue;">here</a>. <br  />Why am I a furry? I shouldn't have to justify why I like things, but... Because I love how people draw and depict their humanoid creature personas or characters and I also like drawing them, I find them really interesting and cute and awesome :)</p>
        <p>I'm also transgender, which I'm mentioning here and only here because my IRLs only know spanish and I'm hoping that the few that know english don't even bother scrolling this far (I'm still closeted (kind of)).</p>

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>I'm from Catalonia, Spain. I was born in Barcelona and I'm trilingual (Catalan, Spanish, English). I grew up here with all the catalan customs and traditions and I like using and promoting the Catalan language.</li>
            <li>I'm currently studying animation and videogame development at a high tertiary level. I've got 2 years remaining of that.</li>
            <li>After I'm done studying, I want to kickstart an independent videogame studio called "Studio ECSP". If that succeeds, I also have plans for a sort of "Indepenent Videogame Alliance" with fellow independent studios and individuals.</li>
            <li>I currently consider myself a game developer, game designer, artist and 3d modeler. Soon, I'll release an EP and also consider me a musician if I deem it good enough!</li>
            <li>I use GameMaker engine for making videogames and I want to learn Godot engine in the future too.</li>
            <li>Currently, the programming languages that I know how to use are GML (GameMaker Language), python and javascript (HTML and CSS are not real programming languages).</li>
            <li>My videogame production, art, 3D modeling and musical production skills have been self taught so far.</li>
            <li>I'm bisexual and a trans woman.</li>
            <li>My furry (scalie?) persona (fursona) (scalesona?) is ECSPdragon, who you might have seen at the website's home page being used as the website and brand mascot.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>ECSPdragon is a "polygonal dragon" (Polydragon for short). Polydragons are a subspecies of dragons that I invented. They live inside digital devices and their bodies look low-poly and like they were modeled for a 90's game console.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>ECSPdragon has two forms:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>The "mascot" form is the one you saw on the home page. The limbs and torso are very simplistic and made to fit a more cartoony mascot vibe.</li>
                <li>The "artist" form is much more anatomically correct with a very feminine shape. I use this one to represent myself as a person (you can see a bit of it in my profile picture in some places).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>My favorite videogames and franchises are Splatoon, Minecraft and ARMS.</li>
            <li>I'd love to tinker with more arduino and raspberry pi stuff in the future. If I didn't focus on videogames, I would've focused on hardware and computer science.</li>
            <li>I use Linux Mint and lots of open source software. I'm a big fan of KDE and what they do :)</li>
            <li>I'm a huge advocate of user freedoms and open source. I believe corporations ruin every single thing they are in charge of managing.</li>
            <li>I'd love to have enough money for a fursuit...</li>
            <li>I'm a sticker addict, I love having stickers of stuff I like. My laptop is covered in so many cool stickers.</li>
            <li>My favorite music genres are EDM, Hyperpop and Psychedelic Pop. Anything with god synths reels me in.</li>
            <li>My favorite music artists are lizzy's personal army, Mild High Club, Creo, Porter Robinson and Incredible Polo.</li>
            <li>I like 3D animation a lot, it's just not what I'm doing right now, but in the future, I'd love to make a 3D animated short!</li>
            <li>My partner is beautiful ❤️</li>
            <li>I like graphic design, but I don't think I'm amazing at it.</li>
            <li>I have so many cool ideas saved up for the future :)</li>
            <li>I wrote a small paper talking about the enshittification of the videogame industry that I plan to post in ecsp.dev soon. This ties to my plan to post things I find worth talking about or sharing as well as things that are interesting and awesome.</li>
            <li>I want to let other people write stuff and post it here too!</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <p>That's all, really. Might update this if I can come up with anything else to put here.</p>
        <p>Goodbye and thanks for reading!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A furry is someone who represents themselves online or in some real life places like conventions with an animal version of themselves, which is usually humanoid, but how humanoid it is depends on the person that designed the furry persona (AKA fursona).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>...and even then, people who do this can also not be furries! Because "furry" is just a tag that unifies an abstract group of people who choose to use it on themselves based on the stuff they like.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>No, furries don't like having sex with animals, that's an uncorrelated thing called being a criminal (zoophile).</li>
            <li>No, furries do not identify as animals, that's an uncorrelated thing called therians.</li>
            <li>No, furries don't wear fursuits literally everywhere (Have you ever been inside a full body suit of any kind? it gets so hot in there).</li>
            <li>What do furries like or do then? Furries just like stuff with humanoid creatures, whether that be talking about/producing media of them or playing pretend with fursuits</li>
            <li>Frankly, if you still hate furries after this explanation, then you're just a hateful dipshit.</li>
