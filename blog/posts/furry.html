        <h2>What is a furry?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A furry is someone who represents themselves online or in some real life places like conventions with an animal version of themselves, which is usually humanoid, but how humanoid it is depends on the person that designed the furry persona (AKA fursona).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>...and even then, people who do this can also not be furries! Because "furry" is just a tag that unifies an abstract group of people who choose to use it on themselves based on the stuff they like.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>No, furries don't want to have sex with animals, that's an uncorrelated thing called being a criminal (zoophile).</li>
            <li>No, furries do not identify as animals or act like animals, that's an uncorrelated thing called therians.</li>
            <li>No, furries don't wear fursuits literally everywhere (Have you ever been inside a full body suit of any kind? it gets so hot in there).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What do furries like or do then? Personally, I became a furry because I find the humanoid creatures furry artists draw and the techniques they use really cool and super interesting and they inspire me to become a better artist! The stuff furry artists draw is super unique and not really able to happen outside the furry context in my opinion.
         I really like having this cool dragon creature that I made with myself and my interests as reference represent me online, it makes me feel happy. I also think being able to act a bit like a dragon online is fun and cute and I like "being just a little lizard girl" :) I'd love to have a fursuit so I could also do it at home, but I'm broke, so... (No, I still don't identify as a lizard girl, this is all just for fun!).<br  />But being a furry is all about sharing your interest for these cool humanoid creatures! This is why the furry community highlights very well its talented creative people and you see so much furry media around the internet. Being a furry is just about having fun with and appreciating these cool characters people make :)</p>
        <p>Are furries still cringe? Pretty much, but being cringe isn't a crime. Cringe is something extremely lame that shitty people use to make fun of people who like and enjoy anything exotic to them. Frankly, if you still hate furries after all of this or think they're bad in any way, then you're just a dipshit. It's okay if this stuff isn't for you, but let us enjoy things, please!<br/>I'd rather be cringe and enjoy things over being "normal" and not being allowed to have fun doing anything!</p>
